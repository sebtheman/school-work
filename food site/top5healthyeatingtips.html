                <b>Make time for meals</b>
                <br>
                <p>Eating 3 meals per day plus snacks will give you energy that will last all day and keep your metabolism active. Pack healthy portable snacks such as fruit or a granola bar when you're on the go.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Balance Your Meals</b>
                <br>
                <p>Eating healthy meals that contain foods from at least 3 different food groups will help to ensure that you get all the nutrition you need to stay healthy! Be sure to eat different combinations of grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, and healthy fats throughout the day.</p>

            <li>
                <b>Don't forget Dairy</b>
                <br>
                <p>Your bones still need calcium to stay strong. Dairy foods and some dairy alternatives, such as enriched soymilk, provide protein as well as calcium.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stay Hydrated</b>
                <br>
                <p>Proper hydration is important for healthy skin and organs. Drink water even if you are not thirsty. Waiting until you are thirsty to have fluids means you are already partially dehydrated. Pack a bottle of water in your backpack or gym bag!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Choose Appropriate Portions</b>
                <br>
                <p>Food portions in restaurants are often more than one serving size and they're getting bigger and bigger. You may not realize how much food you are actually eating. When you are at a restaurant, plan on taking half of your meal home or spilt an entr√©e with a friend. When eating at the dining hall, take smaller portions to start and go back for more if you are still hungry.</p>
