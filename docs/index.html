        <p>Eggs are one of my favourite foods. here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
        <h1><b>Ingeredients</b></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
            <li>2 tbs cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><b>Method</b></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>

            <h2 style="color:chocolate;font-weight:bold;background-color: #0000ff;">The Hobbit to be filmed in Nelson</h2>
            <p style="color:red;">Sir Peter Jackson's movie <b>The Hobbit</b> is set to be filmed in Nelson at the end of this year, with hundreds of crew members expected to stay in the region. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;"">Local moteliers have been contacted by the film's production company, <i>3 Foot 7</i>, which is looking for accommodation for about 400 to 500 people in November and December. Motel Association of New Zealand Nelson's John Gilbertson, who owns <b><i><u>Arrow Motels</u></i></b> on Golf Rd, confirmed some of the association's members were holding rooms for such a group. </p>
            <p style="color:red;">Filming for the anticipated two-part movie resumed last week and will continue until December. The film features international celebrities such as Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Stephen Fry, James Nesbitt and Martin Freeman. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Mr Gilbertson said <i>3 Foot 7</i> made inquiries for booking 400 to 500 rooms in early December in Nelson and Golden Bay. He said there were 50 Nelson members in the association with more than 700 rooms among them, so members could accommodate the film bookings across the region. </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: center;color: red;"><b>The Hobbit</b> publicist Melissa Booth said she was unable to confirm locations as they were in the throes of filming. "We're just looking forward and trying to get the film made. I think everyone is happy to be back at work."</p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Pohara motelier Steve du Feu said the filming of <b>The Hobbit</b> was "good news" for businesses in Golden Bay. His motel, The Sandcastle, is one of a number in Golden Bay that have been booked out by <i>3 Foot 7</i> for 10 days in mid-November and a week in early December. "The increased activity in the bay associated with this will be an awesome boost after what has been a pretty quiet winter. The crew will be made to feel very welcome," he said. </p>
            <p style="color:red;">Bob Haswell of Clifftops Retreat in Ruby Bay said he had friends working on the film in Wellington and "it looks like some of them might be coming to Nelson". Mr Haswell is connected to Tasman Helicopters, which was involved during the filming of parts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the Nelson region, but he said the company had not been approached about helping with <b>The Hobbit</b>. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio said the likelihood that <b>The Hobbit</b> crew might be coming to Nelson was news to him, but he was not surprised. "It's in line with what we have been hearing – that Nelson is going to be a destination for filming." </p>

            <hr style="color: green;height: 10px;background-color: green;">
            <img src="images/teddyphone.jpg" align="right">
            <p>There was a time when children's <b>telecommunications</b> meant two cans connected with string or, for luckier kids, a set of walkie-talkies.  But today the mobile phone has become ubiquitous in school playgrounds, with children as young as five having their own. A company in England is even targeting toddlers with a phone designed in the shape of a teddy bear.</p>
            <p>Three-quarters of Australian children aged 12 to 14 own a mobile phone but by the time they are 15 that number surges to 90 per cent, according to figures from the Australian Communications and Media Authority. </p>
            <p>"Because it's parents who come in and sign up for the phones it's difficult to say exactly how much this area has grown but the age at which kids get phones is getting younger," says Carmen Gould, head of customer service at Australian retail chain Crazy John's. "Whereas before it was often teenagers getting mobiles, it's not unusual now for parents to buy phones for children as young as eight."</p>
            <h2>Why do they have phones?</h2>
            <p>Most parents cite the peace of mind that comes from being able to contact their children at any time as the main reason behind the trend.  "All research into this trend suggests that parents believe that they can improve the safety and security of their children by giving them a phone," says Randal Markey of the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association.</p>
            <p>This view is backed by the most recent study of mobile use among youngsters by the NSW Commission for Children and Young People. After interviewing 1500 children for its Mobile Me report, it concluded it was nearly always parents who decided to get their children phones - to contact them in "case of emergencies". The other reason was that a phone would give greater independence.</p>
            <p>Researchers speak out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In September a Swedish scientist said children and teenagers were five times more likely to get brain cancer if they used a mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Psychologists have warned children can become too reliant on their phones - or "phone addicts".</li>
                <li>Academics suggest that kids are ill prepared to understand the financial responsibilities that come with a mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Some children run up bills of over $500 per month ($6000 per year)</li>
                <li>Young people are more easily drawn into costly long term plans with the offer of cheap or even free phones if they sign up for 12 or 24 month plans</li>
                <li>Most contentious is the research linking mobiles to brain tumours. While the World Health Organisation and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency say there is no evidence of this connection, some researchers say thinner skulls and smaller brains put children at greater risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"It can be a huge problem for some children, who can run up bills of up to $500 a month. They have little concept of what they are spending - this can lead to getting into constant debt, a very bad financial situation which they can carry on into their adult life with things like credit cards."</p>
            <p>As for addiction, two Spanish teenagers made headlines around the world in June when they were admitted to a mental health clinic for "phone addiction". The children, 12 and 13, were sent there by their parents, who said they could not carry out normal activities without their mobiles and would spend six hours a day on them.</p>
            <p>Such extreme behaviour is uncommon, Queensland University of Technology psychologist Shari Walsh says.  "There are certainly teenagers who we are seeing that have an over-reliance on their mobiles and who become anxious at the prospect of going without their phone.  "They worry that they'll run out of battery or credit and they'll be forced to go without this way of communicating with their network of friends. It's a big fear for them and it illustrates just how important they see the phone as being to their lives."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">You could say it was a $13 million save. But to Tony Lochhead, the man who thought he'd cost New Zealand a spot at the biggest sporting show on earth, Mark Paston's heroics were priceless. For 88 minutes on Saturday night, Westpac Stadium was abuzz. But for the other two, there was almost a deathly silence.</p>
            <div class="centreimageforallwhites">
            <img src="images/goal.jpg">
            </div>
            <p id="allwhitestext">It is the 51st minute and referee Jorge Larrionda rules Lochhead has brought down Bahrain's Abdulla Omar inside the box and awards a penalty. It is surreal. Despite a record crowd of 35,194, you could have heard a pin drop.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Lochhead's heart was firmly entrenched in his mouth as he contemplated the potentially devastating scenario, given that a 1-1 draw would have seen Bahrain qualify on the away-goals rule.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I thought I had cost us a trip to the World Cup," the Phoenix defender said."I thought I'd done enough to get there but [Omar] just managed to get in front of me. I didn't really touch him that much, but he went down pretty easily and the ref pointed to the spot. It was such a nerve-racking moment but Pasty has come up with an unbelievable save and he's saved my skin, big time."</p>
            <img src="images/crowd1.jpg" align="right">
            <p id="allwhitestext">"It wasn't a good feeling, but when he saved it I was celebrating as if I had scored myself."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">All Whites captain Ryan Nelsen had his money on Paston to save the shot of Bahrain's rangy centre back, Sayed Mohamed Adnan.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Nelsen, who led manfully, was fifth in line to take a penalty in the eventuality of a shootout and he had lined up himself against Paston in training last week.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I can remember taking a penalty at practice and looking up and seeing Pasty, and I couldn't see any of the goal.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I just saw this big guy in front of it, so I knew he had a chance of saving it and in the end he pulled off a world-class save."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I said to him before the Bahrain game that for us to go through we're going to need a world-class keeper and world-class saves, and throughout 180 minutes he proved incredible."</p>
            <img src="images/crowd2.jpg" align="right">
            <p id="allwhitestext">Paston, 32, the Phoenix goalkeeper who hails from Hawke's Bay, was swamped by his team-mates after the final whistle. They knew how big a part he had played in getting the team to South Africa.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">But the big stopper, who probably would not have even been playing on Saturday had Glen Moss not been suspended, was typically down to earth after the initial euphoria.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I just guessed, actually," he nonchalantly stated of the penalty.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"Apparently they [the coaching staff] were trying to get it out to me from the sideline that [Adnan] goes right, but it didn't get to me, so it's a good job I went that way. He didn't hit the best penalty, but I went the right way and it stuck."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Asked if he had prepared for it, Paston said: "Yeah, but I thought it would be at the end of the game, not in the middle of it."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext"> He heaped praise on the men in front of him.

            <p id="allwhitestext">"The whole second half, the boys were incredible. They were diving into tackles and all sorts. It comes down to that, it was amazing what they did for me."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">And it is amazing what Paston and his team-mates have done for football. Not only did he play a major part in getting the team to the World Cup, but the cash injection for the sport – about $13 million just by qualification – will be crucial.</p>

            <p>Most Australians will be concentrating on the federal election on August 21, but in Alice Springs there is a major diversion scheduled for that date - <b>the annual Henley-on-Todd River Regatta.</b></p>

            <p>Although originally inspired by England's annual Henley-on-Thames Regatta, the Alice version couldn't be more different. The English one is an upper-class social event with a full programme of rowing events.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Alice event is a chaotic mix of races between home-made, bottomless boats of all descriptions, carried by teams of runners down the dry bed of the Todd River - pictures of which have appeared in newspapers all over the world.</p>
            <p>A bathtub race is another feature.</p>
            <p>The river bed is normally dry in mid-winter, and the regatta has been cancelled only once in its 48-year history. Water has flowed four times this year, but organisers are confident that won't happen for this year's event.</p>

            <p>Race prizes on offer include vouchers from Alice Springs businesses and there's a draw for $500 among all competitors</p>

            <p>The day concludes with the Battle Boat Spectacular between the Vikings, the Pirates and a Naval crew with water-pistols and flour bombs as weapons.</p>

            <p><i>For recent high school and college graduates, here is a list of 11 things they did not learn in school.</i></p>
            <p>In his book, Bill Gates talks about how feel-good, politically-correct teachings created a full generation of kids with no concept of reality and how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>RULE 1......Life is not fair; get used to it.
                <li><p>RULE 2......The world won't care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 3......You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone, until you earn both.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 4......If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 5......Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 6......If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 7......Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try "delousing" the closet in your own room.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 8......Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools they have abolished failing grades; they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 9......Life is not divided into semesters. You don't get summer off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.</p>
                <li><p>RULE 10.....Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.</p>

            <img src="HTML practice/pics/truth.jpg">
            <p>Text By Charles J. Sykes Printed in San Diego Union Tribune September 19, 1996 </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there are some things that children should be learning in school, but don't. Not all of them have to do with academics. As a modest back-to-school offering, here are some basic rules that may not have found their way into the standard curriculum. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 1:</b> Life is not fair. Get used to it. The average teen-ager uses the phrase, "It's not fair" 8.6 times a day. You got it from your parents, who said it so often you decided they must be the most idealistic generation ever. When they started hearing it from their own kids, they realized Rule No. 1.</p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 2:</b> The real world won't care as much about your self-esteem as much as your school does. It'll expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about yourself. This may come as a shock. Usually, when inflated self-esteem meets reality, kids complain it's not fair. (See Rule No. 1) </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 3:</b> Sorry, you won't make $40,000 a year right out of high school. And you won't be a vice president or have a car phone either. You may even have to wear a uniform that doesn't have a Gap label. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 4:</b> If you think your teacher is tough, wait 'til you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure, so he tends to be a bit edgier. When you screw up, he's not going to ask you how you feel about it. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 5</b>: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grand-parents had a different word of burger flipping. They called it opportunity. They weren't embarrassed making minimum wage either. They would have been embarrassed to sit around talking about Kurt Cobain all weekend. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 6:</b> It's not your parents' fault. If you screw up, you are responsible. This is the flip side of "It's my life," and "You're not the boss of me," and other eloquent proclamations of your generation. When you turn 18, it's on your dime. Don't whine about it, or you'll sound like a baby boomer. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 7:</b> Before you were born your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your bills, cleaning up your room and listening to you tell them how idealistic you are. And by the way, before you save the rain forest from the blood-sucking parasites of your parents' generation, try delousing the closet in your bedroom. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 8:</b> Your school may have done away with winners and losers. Life hasn't. In some schools, they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. Failing grades have been abolished and class valedictorians scrapped, lest anyone's feelings be hurt. Effort is as important as results. This, of course, bears not the slightest resemblance to anything in real life. (See Rule No. 1, Rule No. 2 and Rule No. 4) </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 9:</b> Life is not divided into semesters, and you don't get summers off. Not even Easter break. They expect you to show up every day. For eight hours. And you don't get a new life every 10 weeks. It just goes on and on. While we're at it, very few jobs are interesting in fostering your self-expression or helping you find yourself. Fewer still lead to self-realization. (See Rule No. 1 and Rule No. 2.) </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 10</b>: Television is not real life. Your life is not a sitcom. Your problems will not all be solved in 30 minutes, minus time for commercials. In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop to go to jobs. Your friends will not be as perky or pliable as Jennifer Aniston. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 11:</b> Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them. We all could. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 12:</b> Smoking does not make you look cool. It makes you look moronic. Next time you're out cruising, watch an 11-year-old with a butt in his mouth. That's what you look like to anyone over 20. Ditto for "expressing yourself" with purple hair and/or pierced body parts. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 13:</b> You are not immortal. (See Rule No. 12.) If you are under the impression that living fast, dying young and leaving a beautiful corpse is romantic, you obviously haven't seen one of your peers at room temperature lately. </p>
            <p><b>Rule No. 14:</b> Enjoy this while you can. Sure parents are a pain, school's a bother, and life is depressing. But someday you'll realize how wonderful it was to be a kid. Maybe you should start now. </p>

                <b>Fireworks</b>
                <p>For hundreds of years, even before Francis Scott Key wrote of seeing "the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air," people have been awed by the bright lights and big noise of fireworks. The ancient Chinese used fireworks at festivities and to frighten enemies in battle. Captain John Smith set them off in Jamestown in 1608, enjoying a bit of English popular entertainment and impressing Native Americans.</p>
                <b>Smoky Origins</b>

                <p>Legend has it that the Chinese made the first fireworks in the 800s, filling bamboo shoots with gunpowder and exploding them at the New Year with the hope that the sound would scare away evil spirits. According to tradition, Marco Polo brought this technology back to Europe. It's fair to say, however, that the origins of fireworks are shrouded in smoke; the China story is widespread, and possibly true, but fireworks may in fact have developed in India or the Arab world. Fireworks became known in Europe during the 1300s, probably after returning Crusaders brought them from the East.</p>

                <b>Explosive Popularity</b>

                <p>By the 1400s Florence, Italy, was the center of fireworks manufacturing. At this time fireworks were just one effect in a celebration rather than its focus. At religious festivals Italians made plaster figures that spewed fireworks from their eyes and mouths. The 1533 coronation parade for Anne Boleyn included a papier-mache dragon that belched fire. During the 1700s displays became more elaborate and were popular with European royalty. French king Louis XV ordered extravagant displays of fireworks at Versailles, and Russian czar Peter the Great put on a five-hour show after the birth of his son. Meanwhile, in the American colonies settlers used fireworks to mark happy occasions. Today fireworks are a key part of celebrating Independence Day in the United States, Guy Fawkes' Day in the United Kingdom, Bastille Day in France, and New Year festivities around the world.</p>

                <b>Colour by Fire</b>
                <p>Early fireworks were enjoyed more for the sound than the show—in its simplest forms gunpowder explodes quickly, leaving a terrific bang but not much to see other than a rather brief golden glow. Over time people discovered that using chemical compounds with greater amounts of oxygen made the explosives burn brighter and longer. The multi-hued displays we know now began in the 1830s, when Italians added trace amounts of metals that burn at high temperatures, creating beautiful colors. Other additives also produced interesting effects. For example, calcium deepens colors, titanium makes sparks, and zinc creates smoke clouds.</p>
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Dangerous Risk?</b>
                <p>Armed with this knowledge, some aficionados enjoy trying to create their own fireworks. But these creations are even more dangerous and unpredictable than legal fireworks. Because homemade fireworks are often made from parts of other fireworks, they can contain deadly amounts of explosive powders.</p>

                    <br><br><br><hr>
                    <p>In 1605 Fawkes unsuccessfully attempted to commit the infamous act of terror of blowing up King James I and the Houses of Parliament.</p>

                    <p>The English, among other talents, are adept at nurturing their grudges. How else does one explain the enduring enmity toward Guy Fawkes, a conspirator in a plot to blow up Parliament in 1605? Some four centuries after Fawkes was caught, tortured and executed for his role in a scheme that never came to fruition, Britons still celebrate his demise each Nov. 5 by burning his likeness in effigy and setting fireworks ablaze. One of the ironies of Fawkes' legacy is that he was a late addition to the infamous "Gunpowder Plot."</p>

                    <p>Born a Protestant in 1570, Fawkes enlisted in the Spanish army in the Netherlands around 1593, shortly after converting to Catholicism. Co-conspirators:</p>

                    <p>enlisted Fawkes as a ringer, reasoning that his military skills ”he had participated in the 1595 capture of Calais, France” and his anonymity as a foreign soldier made him an ideal candidate to help execute their plan. Fawkes' henchmen were zealous Catholics who believed that by beheading the government, they might usher in a new era of Catholicism in Protestant England.</p>

                    <p>Led by Catesby, they hatched a plan to explode gunpowder under Parliament during a state opening, when King James I, his queen, and other family members and government eaders were inside.

                    <p>The plot was set for Nov. 5, 1605, and in the preceding days, the conspirators rented a cellar underneath the building, where Fawkes stashed at least 20 barrels of gunpowder. Things didn't go according to plan. The plotters sought wider support, and, as the story goes, one of the individuals to whom they reached out alerted his brother-in-law, a lord, not to attend Parliament on Nov. 5. The building was searched, and Fawkes was apprehended along with his stockpile of gunpowder. Tortured on the rack, he revealed the names of his co-conspirators. Some of them were killed while resisting arrest; others, including Fawkes, pled not guilty and went to trial, where they were convicted of high treason. In January, 1606, the remaining conspirators were hanged, drawn and quartered. Parliament immediately established Nov. 5 as a day of celebration.</p>

                <h1>Some of the Softest Players in World Football</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>In America, footballers have a reputation for being pansies, divers, cheats and uninterested in good old-fashioned contact.</p>

                <p>Generally, this is untrue. But there are some high-profile players who unfortunately epitomize this stereotype and go through games whining, shouting at referees and crumbling to the ground at the slightest contact.</p>

                <p>There are others who genuinely get injured at the slightest touch and yet more who must continually look for a cushier environment in which to play.</p>

                <p>These most undesirable men are soft footballers, and here are some of the softest in the world.</p>

                    <b>Adel Taarabt</b>
                    <p>Watch any Queens Park Rangers match, and you will see the moody Adel Taarabt throwing himself all over the football pitch as he runs into defenders and loses the ball.

                    <p>In addition to constantly flopping, he has a habit of screaming at the referees that don't believe his histrionic routine, which only serves to disgrace him more.

                    <b>Walcott</b>
                    <p>How do I know that Theo Walcott is a diver? He's admitted it himself.</p>
                    <p>At least he had the guts to apologize for it, but anyone who watches Arsenal regularly knows that Walcott goes down at the slightest touch, and, worse, is a constant complainer.</p>

                    <p>Even after his own mistakes, which include running the ball out of play under absolutely no pressure, he will scream at his teammates for some perceived fault on their part; never acknowledging that it was he who erred.</p>

                    <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</b>
                    <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic's footballing career has just been one protracted saga.</p>
                    <p>He has generated more money in transfer fees than any other player in history, and moves club on an almost yearly basis because he can never stay settled at any one.</p>

                    <p>Whether it was simply not getting along with the manager (Barcelona), not willing to put in the work for a year to get back to the big time (Juventus) or just asking for a ridiculous amount of money (AC Milan), Ibrahimovic always seems to find a way out.</p>

                    <p>And, despite the fact that he is a large, imposing man, he will buckle and whine at the slightest touch on the pitch.</p>

                <img src="Soft Footballers/ronaldo.png" alt="Ronaldo" style="float: right;" width="100px" height="auto">
                <b>Christiano Ronaldo</b>
                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, meet Cristiano Ronaldo, the man who embodies everything that so many hate about the modern footballer.</p>

                <p>Nearly every time he loses the ball, nearly every time a defender so much as touches him, nearly every tricky situation he finds himself in is responded to with a comedic flop and various gesticulations towards the referee.</p>

                <p>Take one look at a man as tall, strong and powerful as Ronaldo, and it is obvious that he doesn't need to do these things and that, if he wanted to, he could play just as well with an honest approach.</p>

                <p>Not C-Ron, though. His remarkable susceptibility to the basic challenge and the normal rigors of a football match make him the single softest player in world football.</p>
