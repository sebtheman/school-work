            <dd>A great colour for restaurant walls. Red stimulates the appetite and encourages people to spend more. Do you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning? Paint the bedroom red. Chances are you will leap out of bed.</dd>
            <dt style="color: #0000ff">Blue</dt>
            <dd>If you’re on a diet, eating areas should be blue. This is a colour that suppresses the appetite. However, blue is a bad colour for living rooms or party rooms because it encourages people to relax and not talk to each other.</dd>
            <dt style="color:#e4e44e">Yellow</dt>
            <dd>Although yellow may seem like a happy colour, it increases irritability.</dd>
            <dd>Avoid painting a room bright yellow, instead use light yellow in a small area if contrast is needed.</dd>
            <dt style=color:#33cc33>Green</dt>
            <dd>This is the colour of perfect balance. It encourages feelings of relaxation and comfort. Actors are often asked to wait in the green room before they perform. It's also great for a bedroom.</dd>

        <div class="hobbit">
            <h2 style="color:chocolate;font-weight:bold;background-color: #0000ff;">The Hobbit to be filmed in Nelson</h2>
            <p style="color:red;">Sir Peter Jackson's movie <b>The Hobbit</b> is set to be filmed in Nelson at the end of this year, with hundreds of crew members expected to stay in the region. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;"">Local moteliers have been contacted by the film's production company, <i>3 Foot 7</i>, which is looking for accommodation for about 400 to 500 people in November and December. Motel Association of New Zealand Nelson's John Gilbertson, who owns <b><i><u>Arrow Motels</u></i></b> on Golf Rd, confirmed some of the association's members were holding rooms for such a group. </p>
            <p style="color:red;">Filming for the anticipated two-part movie resumed last week and will continue until December. The film features international celebrities such as Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Stephen Fry, James Nesbitt and Martin Freeman. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Mr Gilbertson said <i>3 Foot 7</i> made inquiries for booking 400 to 500 rooms in early December in Nelson and Golden Bay. He said there were 50 Nelson members in the association with more than 700 rooms among them, so members could accommodate the film bookings across the region. </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;text-align: center;color: red;"><b>The Hobbit</b> publicist Melissa Booth said she was unable to confirm locations as they were in the throes of filming. "We're just looking forward and trying to get the film made. I think everyone is happy to be back at work."</p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Pohara motelier Steve du Feu said the filming of <b>The Hobbit</b> was "good news" for businesses in Golden Bay. His motel, The Sandcastle, is one of a number in Golden Bay that have been booked out by <i>3 Foot 7</i> for 10 days in mid-November and a week in early December. "The increased activity in the bay associated with this will be an awesome boost after what has been a pretty quiet winter. The crew will be made to feel very welcome," he said. </p>
            <p style="color:red;">Bob Haswell of Clifftops Retreat in Ruby Bay said he had friends working on the film in Wellington and "it looks like some of them might be coming to Nelson". Mr Haswell is connected to Tasman Helicopters, which was involved during the filming of parts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the Nelson region, but he said the company had not been approached about helping with <b>The Hobbit</b>. </p>
            <p style="color:purple;">Nelson Mayor Aldo Miccio said the likelihood that <b>The Hobbit</b> crew might be coming to Nelson was news to him, but he was not surprised. "It's in line with what we have been hearing – that Nelson is going to be a destination for filming." </p>

            <hr style="color: green;height: 10px;background-color: green;">
            <img src="images/teddyphone.jpg" align="right">
            <p>There was a time when children's <b>telecommunications</b> meant two cans connected with string or, for luckier kids, a set of walkie-talkies.  But today the mobile phone has become ubiquitous in school playgrounds, with children as young as five having their own. A company in England is even targeting toddlers with a phone designed in the shape of a teddy bear.</p>
            <p>Three-quarters of Australian children aged 12 to 14 own a mobile phone but by the time they are 15 that number surges to 90 per cent, according to figures from the Australian Communications and Media Authority. </p>
            <p>"Because it's parents who come in and sign up for the phones it's difficult to say exactly how much this area has grown but the age at which kids get phones is getting younger," says Carmen Gould, head of customer service at Australian retail chain Crazy John's. "Whereas before it was often teenagers getting mobiles, it's not unusual now for parents to buy phones for children as young as eight."</p>
            <h2>Why do they have phones?</h2>
            <p>Most parents cite the peace of mind that comes from being able to contact their children at any time as the main reason behind the trend.  "All research into this trend suggests that parents believe that they can improve the safety and security of their children by giving them a phone," says Randal Markey of the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association.</p>
            <p>This view is backed by the most recent study of mobile use among youngsters by the NSW Commission for Children and Young People. After interviewing 1500 children for its Mobile Me report, it concluded it was nearly always parents who decided to get their children phones - to contact them in "case of emergencies". The other reason was that a phone would give greater independence.</p>
            <p>Researchers speak out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In September a Swedish scientist said children and teenagers were five times more likely to get brain cancer if they used a mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Psychologists have warned children can become too reliant on their phones - or "phone addicts".</li>
                <li>Academics suggest that kids are ill prepared to understand the financial responsibilities that come with a mobile phone.</li>
                <li>Some children run up bills of over $500 per month ($6000 per year)</li>
                <li>Young people are more easily drawn into costly long term plans with the offer of cheap or even free phones if they sign up for 12 or 24 month plans</li>
                <li>Most contentious is the research linking mobiles to brain tumours. While the World Health Organisation and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency say there is no evidence of this connection, some researchers say thinner skulls and smaller brains put children at greater risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>"It can be a huge problem for some children, who can run up bills of up to $500 a month. They have little concept of what they are spending - this can lead to getting into constant debt, a very bad financial situation which they can carry on into their adult life with things like credit cards."</p>
            <p>As for addiction, two Spanish teenagers made headlines around the world in June when they were admitted to a mental health clinic for "phone addiction". The children, 12 and 13, were sent there by their parents, who said they could not carry out normal activities without their mobiles and would spend six hours a day on them.</p>
            <p>Such extreme behaviour is uncommon, Queensland University of Technology psychologist Shari Walsh says.  "There are certainly teenagers who we are seeing that have an over-reliance on their mobiles and who become anxious at the prospect of going without their phone.  "They worry that they'll run out of battery or credit and they'll be forced to go without this way of communicating with their network of friends. It's a big fear for them and it illustrates just how important they see the phone as being to their lives."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">You could say it was a $13 million save. But to Tony Lochhead, the man who thought he'd cost New Zealand a spot at the biggest sporting show on earth, Mark Paston's heroics were priceless. For 88 minutes on Saturday night, Westpac Stadium was abuzz. But for the other two, there was almost a deathly silence.</p>
            <div class="centreimageforallwhites">
            <img src="images/goal.jpg">
            </div>
            <p id="allwhitestext">It is the 51st minute and referee Jorge Larrionda rules Lochhead has brought down Bahrain's Abdulla Omar inside the box and awards a penalty. It is surreal. Despite a record crowd of 35,194, you could have heard a pin drop.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Lochhead's heart was firmly entrenched in his mouth as he contemplated the potentially devastating scenario, given that a 1-1 draw would have seen Bahrain qualify on the away-goals rule.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I thought I had cost us a trip to the World Cup," the Phoenix defender said."I thought I'd done enough to get there but [Omar] just managed to get in front of me. I didn't really touch him that much, but he went down pretty easily and the ref pointed to the spot. It was such a nerve-racking moment but Pasty has come up with an unbelievable save and he's saved my skin, big time."</p>
            <img src="images/crowd1.jpg" align="right">
            <p id="allwhitestext">"It wasn't a good feeling, but when he saved it I was celebrating as if I had scored myself."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">All Whites captain Ryan Nelsen had his money on Paston to save the shot of Bahrain's rangy centre back, Sayed Mohamed Adnan.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Nelsen, who led manfully, was fifth in line to take a penalty in the eventuality of a shootout and he had lined up himself against Paston in training last week.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I can remember taking a penalty at practice and looking up and seeing Pasty, and I couldn't see any of the goal.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I just saw this big guy in front of it, so I knew he had a chance of saving it and in the end he pulled off a world-class save."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I said to him before the Bahrain game that for us to go through we're going to need a world-class keeper and world-class saves, and throughout 180 minutes he proved incredible."</p>
            <img src="images/crowd2.jpg" align="right">
            <p id="allwhitestext">Paston, 32, the Phoenix goalkeeper who hails from Hawke's Bay, was swamped by his team-mates after the final whistle. They knew how big a part he had played in getting the team to South Africa.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">But the big stopper, who probably would not have even been playing on Saturday had Glen Moss not been suspended, was typically down to earth after the initial euphoria.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"I just guessed, actually," he nonchalantly stated of the penalty.</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">"Apparently they [the coaching staff] were trying to get it out to me from the sideline that [Adnan] goes right, but it didn't get to me, so it's a good job I went that way. He didn't hit the best penalty, but I went the right way and it stuck."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">Asked if he had prepared for it, Paston said: "Yeah, but I thought it would be at the end of the game, not in the middle of it."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext"> He heaped praise on the men in front of him.

            <p id="allwhitestext">"The whole second half, the boys were incredible. They were diving into tackles and all sorts. It comes down to that, it was amazing what they did for me."</p>

            <p id="allwhitestext">And it is amazing what Paston and his team-mates have done for football. Not only did he play a major part in getting the team to the World Cup, but the cash injection for the sport – about $13 million just by qualification – will be crucial.</p>

            <p>Most Australians will be concentrating on the federal election on August 21, but in Alice Springs there is a major diversion scheduled for that date - <b>the annual Henley-on-Todd River Regatta.</b></p>

            <p>Although originally inspired by England's annual Henley-on-Thames Regatta, the Alice version couldn't be more different. The English one is an upper-class social event with a full programme of rowing events.</p>
            <div class="imagecenter">

            <img src="HenlyWebEx/Henly_04.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>The Alice event is a chaotic mix of races between home-made, bottomless boats of all descriptions, carried by teams of runners down the dry bed of the Todd River - pictures of which have appeared in newspapers all over the world.</p>
            <p>A bathtub race is another feature.</p>
            <p>The river bed is normally dry in mid-winter, and the regatta has been cancelled only once in its 48-year history. Water has flowed four times this year, but organisers are confident that won't happen for this year's event.</p>

            <p>Race day starts with a parade down Todd Mall before the opening ceremony at 11am. Regatta Commodore Ron Saint says he would like to see all those making their own boats joining in.</p>

            <p>Race prizes on offer include vouchers from Alice Springs businesses and there's a draw for $500 among all competitors</p>

            <p>The day concludes with the Battle Boat Spectacular between the Vikings, the Pirates and a Naval crew with water-pistols and flour bombs as weapons.</p>
